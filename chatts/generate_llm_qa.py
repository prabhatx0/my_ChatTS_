The generated QA pairs should not be repetitive, and the answers can be relatively long and rich, leaning towards human preferences. Specific time series feature must **not** be mentioned in the question (e.g., using words like "the spike of amplitude 50", "the sudden increase in the time series") as we will provide them. Just use words like "according to the time series" or "according to the values near point 50".
